This data reproduces the results of “Investigation of direction- and age-dependent prestretch in mouse cranial dura mater”, submitted to the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

Abaqus/Python scripts used for the creation of the neonate and adult mouse models, and the user material subroutine are provided for the reproduction of all the simulations included in the paper.

Abaqus/Python and Python scripts used for the extraction, analysis, and plotting of experimental and computational data are also included within this repository. 

User instructions are included for running all simulations and plotting the resulting results.
